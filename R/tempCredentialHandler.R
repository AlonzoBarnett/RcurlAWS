#' @title tempCredentialHandler
#' @description Initializes a call to STS or pulls instance meta data
#' @param rootCredentials (AWSRootCredentials) Your root credential object to feed STS calls
#' @param roleArn (string) the ARN of the role you want to assume
#' @param RoleSessionName (string) An identifier for the request; this can be used for user auditing on AWS.
#' @param MFADeviceSerialNumber (string) The id number (serial | arn) of your MFA device.
#' @param Duration (string) Duration, in seconds, of the role session; controls time-to-expire of temporary credentials.
#'
#' @details
#' This function isn't intended to be called directly; it is a method of the AWSTemporaryCredentials class.
#' Initializes a call to STS or pulls instance meta data.
#'    Exactly which depends on the arguments you pass.
#' 1. If root credentials are passed, it will call STS.
#'    - Only the root credentials and roleArn are required.
#'    - If you have an account with MFA, you must pass your MFA SN.
#'    - This only works with Assume Role for now, thus the requirement of a roleARN.
#'
#' 2. Otherwise, it will try to curl instance metadata and get temporary credentials from there.
#'
#' For additional information on STS requests refer to [STS Requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html)
