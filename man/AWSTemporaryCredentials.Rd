\format{An object of class \code{R6ClassGenerator} of length 24.}
\usage{
AWSTemporaryCredentials
}
\arguments{
\item{rootCredentials}{(AWSRootCredentials) Your root credential object to feed STS calls}

\item{roleArn}{(string) the ARN of the role you want to assume}

\item{RoleSessionName}{(string) An identifier for the request; this can be used for user auditing on AWS.}

\item{MFADeviceSerialNumber}{(string) The id number (serial | arn) of your MFA device.}

\item{Duration}{(string) Duration, in seconds, of the role session; controls time-to-expire of temporary credentials.}

R6 implementation of AWS Temporary Credential searches and management

   RoleSessionName = NULL,
   MFADeviceSerialNumber = NULL,
   Duration = "3600"

\details{
For additional information on STS requests refer to [STS Requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html)
Initializes a call to STS or pulls instance meta data.
   Exactly which depends on the arguments you pass.
1. If root credentials are passed, it will call STS.
   - Only the root credentials and roleArn are required.
   - If you have an account with MFA, you must pass your MFA SN.
   - This only works with Assume Role for now, thus the requirement of a roleARN.
2. Otherwise, it will try to curl instance metadata and get temporary credentials from there.

\code{$print()} similar behavior to \code{\link{AWSRootCredentials}}
\code{$hasExpired()} boolean check of stale temporary credentials
\code{$rotate()} invokes the initilization function again, but should retain knowledge of Root Credentials if used.
